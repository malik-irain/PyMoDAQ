TCP/IP communication
====================

This section is for people who want an answer to: *I have a detector or an actuator controlled on a distant computer and
cannot have it on the main computer, do you have a solution?*

The answer is of course : *YES*

For this, you have two options:

* install PyMoDAQ to control your hardware on the distant computer
* Use a software on the distant computer that can use TCP/IP communication following the rules given below

With PyMoDAQ
++++++++++++

From version 1.6.0, each actuator (DAQ_Move) or detector (DAQ_Viewer) module can be connected to their counterpart on a
distant computer. For both modules, a TCPServer plugin is available and can be initialized. It will serve as a bridge
between the main computer, running for instance a DAQ_Scan module, and the distant one running a usual DAQ_Move or DAQ_Viewer
module, see :numref:`tcpip_scheme`. Every parameter of the distant module will be exported on its server counterpart. Any modification
of these parameters, either on the server or on the local module, will be updated on either the local module or the server module.

On another software
+++++++++++++++++++

The TCP_server plugin can also be used as a bridge between PyMoDAQ and another custom software (installed locally or
on a distant computer) able to initialize a TCP client and understand PyMoDAQ's TCP/IP communications. For instance, at
CEMES, we've build such a bridge between Digital Micrograph running (eventually) on a distant computer and controlling
a specific Gatan camera on an electron microscope. The communication framework used by PyMoDAQ is as follow:

Serializing objects
-------------------

When dealing with TCP/IP one should first transforms object into `bytes` string (the message) and implement a mechanism
to inform the client (or the server) on the length of the message. For each message (whatever the underlying object),
the first 4 bytes are coding an integer whose value will be the length of the following message. Using this simple
rule allow to send very complex objects.

To make sure there is a robust way to handle this in PyMoDAQ, two objects have been
created, see: ref:`tcp_ip_serializer`, respectively the :class:`~pymodaq.utils.tcp_ip.serializer.Serializer` and
:class:`~pymodaq.utils.tcp_ip.serializer.DeSerializer` objects to convert a python
object to bytes and from bytes to an object.

They both implements specific methods applicable to a given object but also a generic one:

.. code-block::


from pymodaq_data.serialize.serializer_legacy import Serializer, DeSerializer
    >>> string = 'Hello'
    >>> ser = Serializer(string)
    >>> print(ser.string_serialization(string))
    b'\x00\x00\x00\x05Hello'

In this example, the serializer first send 4 bytes encoding the length of the
    >>> string = 'Hello'
    >>> ser = Serializer(string)
    >>> print(ser.string_serialization(string))
    b'\x00\x00\x00\x05Hello'

In this example, the serializer first send 4 bytes encoding the length of the *Hello* string: `\x00\x00\x00\x05`
which is the binary representation of the integer `5`. Then the binary string is appended: `b'Hello`.

Similar methods exists for numbers, arrays, list, :class:`~pymodaq.utils.data.Axis`,
:class:`~pymodaq.utils.data.DataWithAxes`...

The serialization can also be simplified using the :meth:`~pymodaq.utils.tcp_ip.serializer.Serializer.to_bytes`
method:

.. code-block::

    >>> Serializer(['Hello', 'World']).to_bytes()
    b'\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\x00\x00\x06string\x00\x00\x00\x05Hello\x00\x00\x00\x06string\x00\x00\x00\x05World'

Here the :meth:`~pymodaq.utils.tcp_ip.serializer.Serializer.list_serialization` method has been used under the hood.

To recreate back the initial object, one should use the :class:`~pymodaq.utils.tcp_ip.serializer.DeSerializer` object:

.. code-block::

    >>> DeSerializer(b'\x00\x00\x00\x05Hello').string_deserialization()
    Hello
    >>> DeSerializer(b'\x00\x00\x00\x03<f8\x00\x00\x00\x08fffffF_@').scalar_deserialization()
    125.1

As you see you have to know in advance which method to apply first. Therefore there is a generic
recipe for each type of objects that doesn't need to know in advance what this object is.

.. note::

  Each main type of object has its serializing/deserializing method. However the easiest way to use this class is
  by using their generic and symmetric methods:

  .. code-block::

    serialized = Serializer().type_and_object_serialization(obj)

  that will encode in bytes any kind of objects among:

  * bytes
  * str
  * numbers (float or integer)
  * bool
  * ndarray
  * ParameterWithPath (kind of Parameter object)
  * Axis
  * DataWithAxes (and all its derived flavors)
  * DataToExport
  * list (of any kind of objects above)

  and

  .. code-block::

    obj_back = DeSerializer(serialized).type_and_object_deserialization()

  that will return the same objects that has been serialized

Making sure messages are complete:
----------------------------------

Message send on a tcp/ip connection can sometimes be send as chunks, it is therefore important to know what will be the
length of the message to be sent or to be received. PyMoDAQ use the following methods to make sure the message is
entirely send or entirely received:

.. code-block:: python

    def check_received_length(sock,length):
        l=0
        data_bytes=b''
        while l<length:
            if l<length-4096:
                data_bytes_tmp=sock.recv(4096)
            else:
                data_bytes_tmp=sock.recv(length-l)
            l+=len(data_bytes_tmp)
            data_bytes+=data_bytes_tmp
        #print(data_bytes)
        return data_bytes

    def check_sended(socket, data_bytes):
        sended = 0
        while sended < len(data_bytes):
            sended += socket.send(data_bytes[sended:])

Sending and receiving commands (or message):
--------------------------------------------

Serializing and letting know the length of the message is not enough to recreate the initial object. One should add
first a command/info on what to expect from the tcp/ip pipe. Depending on the value of this message the application
know what deserialization to apply.

The PyMoDAQ client/server control modules are using specific commands as strings that should be either:

* Client receiving messages:
    * For all modules: ``Info``, ``Infos``, ``Info_xml``, ``set_info``
    * For a detector:  ``Send Data 0D``, ``Send Data 1D``, ``Send Data 2D``
    * For an actuator: ``move_abs``, ``move_home``, ``move_rel``, ``check_position``, ``stop_motion``
* Client sending messages:
    * For all modules: ``Quit``, ``Done``, ``Info``, ``Infos``, ``Info_xml``
    * For a detector:  ``x_axis``, ``y_axis``
    * For an actuator: ``position_is``, ``move_done``


The principles of communication within PyMoDAQ are summarized on figure :numref:`tcpip_fig` and as follow:

To be send, the string is converted to bytes. The length of this converted string is then computed and also
converted to bytes. The converted length is first send through the socket connection and then the converted
command is also sent.

For the message to be properly received, the client listen on the socket. The first bytes to arrive represent the
length of the message (number of bytes).


For the detail of the python utility functions used to convert, send and receive data see :ref:`tcpip_API`.

Sending and receiving Datas:
----------------------------

Sending or receiving datas is very similar to messages except that datas have a type (integer, float...) and have also a
dimensionality: 0D, 1D, ... Moreover, the datas exported from plugins and viewers are almost always numpy arrays within
a list. One should therefore take all this into consideration. Below is an example of the recipe for
serializing/deserializing DataWithAxes objects:


.. code-block::

    def dwa_serialization(self, dwa: DataWithAxes) -> bytes:
        """ Convert a DataWithAxes into a bytes string

        Parameters
        ----------
        dwa: DataWithAxes

        Returns
        -------
        bytes: the total bytes message to serialize the DataWithAxes

        Notes
        -----
        The bytes sequence is constructed as:

        * serialize the string type: 'DataWithAxes'
        * serialize the timestamp: float
        * serialize the name
        * serialize the source enum as a string
        * serialize the dim enum as a string
        * serialize the distribution enum as a string
        * serialize the list of numpy arrays
        * serialize the list of labels
        * serialize the origin
        * serialize the nav_index tuple as a list of int
        * serialize the list of axis
        """

and obviously the deserialization process is symmetric:

.. code-block::

    def dwa_deserialization(self) -> DataWithAxes:
        """Convert bytes into a DataWithAxes object

        Convert the first bytes into a DataWithAxes reading first information about the underlying data

        Returns
        -------
        DataWithAxes: the decoded DataWithAxes
        """
        class_name = self.string_deserialization()
        if class_name not in DwaType.names():
            raise TypeError(f'Attempting to deserialize a DataWithAxes flavor but got the bytes for a {class_name}')
        timestamp = self.scalar_deserialization()
        dwa = getattr(data_mod, class_name)(self.string_deserialization(),
                                            source=self.string_deserialization(),
                                            dim=self.string_deserialization(),
                                            distribution=self.string_deserialization(),
                                            data=self.list_deserialization(),
                                            labels=self.list_deserialization(),
                                            origin=self.string_deserialization(),
                                            nav_indexes=tuple(self.list_deserialization()),
                                            axes=self.list_deserialization(),
                                            )

And because control modules send signals with `DataToExport` objects, there is also a recipe for these.


Custom client: how to?
----------------------

#. The TCP/Client should first try to connect to the server (using TCP server PyMoDAQ plugin), once the connection is
   accepted, it should send an identification, the ``client type`` (*GRABBER* or *ACTUATOR* command)
#. (optional) Then it can send some information about its configuration as an xml string following the
   :meth:`pymodaq.utils.parameter.ioxml.parameter_to_xml_string` method.
#. Then the client enters a loop waiting for input from the server and is ready to read commands on the socket
#. Receiving commands
    * For a detector:  ``Send Data 0D``, ``Send Data 1D``, ``Send Data 2D``
    * For an actuator: ``move_abs``, ``move_home``, ``move_rel``, ``check_position``, ``stop_motion``
#. Processing internally the command
#. Giving a reply
    * For a detector:
        * Send the command ``Done``
        * Send the data as a ``DataToExport`` object
    * For an actuator:
        * Send a reply depending on the one it received:
            * ``move_done`` for ``move_abs``, ``move_home``, ``move_rel`` commands
            * ``position_is`` for ``check_position`` command
        * Send the position as a ``DataActuator`` object


Pretty easy, isn't it?

Well, if it isn't you can have a look in the example folder where a Labview based TCP client has been
programed. It emulates all the rules stated above, and if you are a Labview user, you're lucky ;-) but should really
think on moving on to python with PyMoDAQ...
