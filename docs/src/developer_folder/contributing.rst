How to contribute
#################

If you're willing to help, there are several ways to do it:


* Use PyMoDAQ and report bug or issues using github issue tracker
* Talk about PyMoDAQ to your colleagues
* Cite PyMoDAQ in your papers
* Add your instruments in plugins (see :ref:`instrument_plugin_doc`)
* Work on new features, on solving bugs or issues

For the last point, here are some pointers:

you should fork and clone the up-to-date GitHub repo: https://github.com/PyMoDAQ
using git command line or GitHub Desktop. Then create a dedicated branch name from the change you want to work on
(using git).

Finally it is advised to create a dedicated virtual environment for this and install PyMoDAQ's package as a developer. For example, using mamba as an environment manager:

- ``mamba create -n dev_env``
- ``mamba activate dev_env``
- ``cd`` to the location of the folder where you downloaded or cloned the repository.
- install the package as a developer with test tools using the command ``pip install -e ".[dev]"``.
    - the `-e` option tells pip to install the package in editable mode, meaning that any change done to the source will be reported to the installed package.
    - the `".[dev]"` argument indicate to install the current folder as a package alongside its optional dependancies, declared as `dev` in the `pyproject.toml` file.
    - the quotes around `[dev]` just allow to escape the sequence in order to not be interpreted by the shell.


Then any change on the code will be *seen* by python interpreter so that you can see and test your modifications. Think about
writing tests that will make sure your code is sound and that modification elsewhere doesn't change the expected behavior.

It also requires the installation of a QT backend and some system packages on Linux, like explained in :ref:`the installation tips page <installation_tips>` of the documentation.

When ready, you can create a pull request from your code into the proper branch, as discussed in the next section.

Branch structure and release cycle
##################################
.. _branches_release_cycle_doc:

There are several branches of the PyMoDAQ repository, directly linked to the *release cycle* of PyMoDAQ, which we
define here. PyMoDAQ versioning follows usual practice, as described `in this link <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning>`_:

    :width: 150
    :align: center

Starting from January 2024, the following structure was agreed upon by the contributors. At any given time,
there is a **stable** version of PyMoDAQ - at the time of writing it is 4.1.0 - which is not to be modified except for
bugfixes, and a **development** version (currently, 4.2.0), onto which new features may be added.

The release cycle is illustrated in this figure:

.. figure:: /image/tutorial_contribute_to_pymodaq_code/release_cycle_pymodaq3.png

This cycle makes use of several types of branches:

**Code flow branches:**

* **the stable branch, eg: '4.1.x'** This is the branch representing the stable version of PyMoDAQ. No change should be
  made on this branch except bugfixes and hotfixes (see below). This is the branch from which the official releases are
  created, for instance version 4.1.0, 4.1.1, 4.1.2, etc.

* **the development branch, eg: '4.2.x_dev** Note that the branch name differs from the stable branch by one increment
  on the minor revision number (2 instead of 1), and the '_dev' suffix is added for clarity.
  This is the development branch. It is *ahead* of the main branch, in the sense that it contains more
  recent commits than the main branch. It is thus the future state of the code. This is where the last developments
  of the code of PyMoDAQ are pushed. When the developers are happy with the state of this branch, typically when they
  finished to develop a new functionality and they tested it, this will lead to a new *release* of PyMoDAQ (4.1.x -> 4.2.0 in our example).
  In practice, the branch will simply be renamed from *4.2.x_dev* to *4.2.x*, and a new branch *4.3.x_dev* will be created
  to continue the cycle.

**Temporary branches:**

* **Feature, eg: 'feature/new_colors'**: Any additional feature should be done on a feature branch. They are created based
  on the current development branch. When the feature is complete, a Pull Request must be open to integrate the changes into
  the development branch.

* **Bugfix, eg: 'bugfix/remove_annoying_message'**: These branches are meant to correct small issues. It can be created based
  on either the stable or development branch, depending on where the bug is located. Regardless, any bugfix must then be applied to
  all branches, if applicable (see note below).

* **Hotfix, eg: 'hotfix/fix_huge_bug'**: This is similar to a bugfix, but for more important bugs. More precisely, hotfixes
  are important enough that when applied, they will trigger an immediate new release (e.g. *4.1.1* -> *4.1.2*) that incorporate the fix.
  At the contrary bugfixes can wait for a future release.

.. note::
    **Applying fixes across several branches**

    Let's consider the case where a bug is found on the **stable** branch. We create a new branch to fix it, open a pull request
    into the stable branch, and wait for it to be accepted. However, it is likely that the buggy code is also part of the
    **development** version, requiring another pull request on that branch! Thus, but when a bug is found, one should always
    remember to check if it is present on several branches.

Where to contribute
###################

There are easy places where to contribute and some more obscure places... After a few years of code rewriting/enhancing,
several places are available for easily adding functionalities. These places are implementing one form or another of the
`Factory Pattern`__. For other places, you'll have to read the API documentation :-)
